# Welcome to powerd6's insider pages!

These pages are aimed at writers and contributors to the project, and they contain all manner of documentation and guides to work with powerd6.

## Getting started?

### Are you a writer interested in a how-to?

Check out the ["Writing Modules"](/writers/writing-modules) series of guides.

### Are you a new contributor wanting to get up-to-speed with the project?

Thanks for joining us! You can start by reading the ["Must know"](/contributors/must-know) page. More technical documentation is available under the ["Technical stuff"](/contributors/technical-stuff) section.

## Forewarning

This website is better viewed on larger screens.

We want to support mobile screens but that is a secondary objective at the moment.
