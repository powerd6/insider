Here are the main goals of the project:

## Improve the experience of playing role-playing games with custom content

The current experience of a group of players looking to use home-brews is chaotic and scattered.

Combining official rulebooks, items or monster source from other books, custom rules specific to the group, etc is often a tiring experience and requires all involved to be mindful of the content they are reading and continuously consider how each piece of content affects the rest. 

By enabling the creation of a single source of truth for rules and content (items, monsters, spells, etc), groups of players will still have the control they previously had, without the burden of maintaining and curating sprawling piles of books.

## Create a comfortable environment for creators looking to write and share modularized content

Writing role-playing games is a complex task.

For the lack of better tools, writers are often left to use tools built for other purposes.

The creation of a highly integrated ecosystem of standards and tools enables writers to create complex systems in a logical manner, keeping cognitive load low and extensibility high.

## Enable the creation of an endlessly-customizable role-playing systems

By leveraging the tools created for readers and writers, the creation of a modular and extensive role-playing system will be possible.

By enabling more writers to share their content, an ecosystem of modules will be available for players to combine.
