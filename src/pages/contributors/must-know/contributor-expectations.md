title: Contributor Expectations
---

When working together, having clear expectations are helpful to keep things running smoothly.

These are the expectations this project imposes on it's contributors:

## Be kind

All contributors are expected to treat others with respect and dignity, regardless of any other factor.

> Everyone is doing the best that they can with the resources they have.

A good rule of thumb is to extend to others the type of kindness and respect that you would benefit from were you having a bad day.

## Research first

It is okay to not know everything. Projects can be big and daunting, but the key to most questions (hopefully) lies in documentation.

This project tries to centralize the knowledge under this website, as such, contributors are expected to read through at least the ["Must know"](/contributors/must-know) articles.

## Learn from mistakes

Humans are fallible, we make mistakes.

In order to help others go further than we did, documentation and guides can be provided, highlighting the sharp corners we cut ourselves in and making the experience of the next contributor better.

Creating experiments, showcasing errors (and sometimes their solutions), and curating documentation to improve its clarity and accuracy are vital for the perpetuation of the project.

## Write for the reader

When presented with choice, choose the reader's comfort over your own.

Prefer clear abstractions and words over convoluted or clever solutions.

The number of people that will read your material is greater or equal to the number of people that will write it.
